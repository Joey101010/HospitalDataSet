#Analysis of Fictional Hospital.

This Power BI Report is based on a dataset containing vists, procedure times, deceased patients, insurance, patients coverage of hospital costs, base costs.. I created this report using Dax, Power BI visuals and Power Query.

#About

This was my fourth project that I did after creating a report for my company which was a incident tracker. No help this time, this is strictly done based off of the knowledge I have obtained. Still learning though.
